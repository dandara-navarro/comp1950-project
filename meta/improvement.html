                    <h2>Usability </h2>
                    <p>The initial design of COMP 1950 is clutter with lots of information 
                        and it is confusing for first time users to find information they 
                        need. For those who have been to the web page, it often requires a 
                        lot of clicking and scroll in order to find the information they 
                        need. In our newly designed page, we simply the user interface so 
                        that users can easily navigate to different section and find the 
                        information they need.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Landing Page</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Simplified landing page with visual and easy-to-find 
                            button provide quick and easy access to different pages of 
                            the webpage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reorganize information so it is not clutter and easy to read. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Short summery of the course and easy-to-find contact information 
                            of the instructor at the footer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Include image and comfortable color scheme to make webpage more 
                            sophisticated and inviting. As this is a web design and development 
                            course, a more sophisticate webpage will boost users’ confidence 
                            in the course being offer. Using BCIT colour scheme – consistent 
                            design to remind user that this is part of BCIT web page. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Website is responsive: it can be view in different size of device 
                            without issue with content being cut off or difficult to read.  This 
                            enable users to check the website for quick access or study using 
                            their mobile devices.

                        <h3>Content Page: Lecture/About/Resource</h3>

                                section of the lecture without excessive scrolling. It also 
                                shows which section the user is currently reading.

                            <li>
                                Links to different lecture on the top left corner – user can 
                                jump to different lecture easily

                    <h2>SEO</h2>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the page is always on the top of the relevant search result, 
                        we made the following changes to improve Search Engine Optimization:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Webpage is set up in HTML – the standard HTML version that W3C 
                            recommends. Content marked up in HTML 5 are more semantic and future 
                            proof. The new tags from HTML 5 provides more information for search 
                            engine to identify and sort our website according to our content. As 
                            this is commonly used across browsers, we can expect the structure of 
                            the document will be consistent across browsers. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Webpage is also set up in CSS3. Although this is not the current W3C 
                            recommendation, but it provides more control over the layer and style of 
                            the web page. It is also mostly supported across browser and we can expect 
                            our layout will be consistent across browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We used Character Set and lang Attribute to indicate how our content 
                            should be rendered in what language to ensure all content is displayed properly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We set up title and link address with descriptive wording so that it is obvious 
                            to user and search engine on what the web page is about. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To decrease site load time, css codes are minified. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Links to BCIT webpage – which is a reputable web site which would help boost our site’s reputation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
